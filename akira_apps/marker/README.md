# Marker detection #


## Install ##

Download the following packages in your catkin workspace and compile them with catkin_make:

```
https://bitbucket.org/iocchi/apriltags_ros
```

For USB camera, install ROS nodes

```
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-usb-cam ros-kinetic-image-view ros-kinetic-cv-bridge 
```

Note: if you get errors in linked libraries, you may need to recompile ros packages, since this update may change the version of OpenCV libraries.


## Run ##

* Write and run your Python program (see robot_program_1.py as an example).

```
$ roslaunch xtion_tags.launch
```

* Detections are published in the ROS topic /tag_detections
